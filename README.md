# Renamer

I needed to rename multiple files on my system so as a beginner programmer I wrote a simple C program to format the name of a file.

Spaces " " are replaced with underscores "\_".
Uppercase letters "A" are replaced with lowercase ones "a".
So "Test File.txt" is renamed to "test_file.txt"
